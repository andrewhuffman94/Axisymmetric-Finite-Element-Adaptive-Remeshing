# Axisymmetric-Finite-Element-Adaptive-Remeshing
I wrote this code to perform an adaptive remeshing step to be implemented as part of an Arbirtrary Lagrangian Eulerian model for numerically simulating direct cone penetration. This adaptive remeshing approach is to be implemented with my advisor, Dr. Diane Moug's cone pentertation model (Moug, D.M. (2017). “Axisymmetric cone penetration model for sands and clays.” PhD Thesis, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Davis), which is run in FLAC. My adaptive remeshing contribution extends the original model's capabilities from modelling penetration in a soil column at a single depth to continuously simulating penetration through a soil column.
